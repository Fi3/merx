**mÃ¨r | ce** s. f. [lat. merx mercis]:
[*something meant to be divided, distributable portion.*](https://www.etimo.it/?term=merce&find=Cerca)

[Here](https://github.com/fi3/pinoedino) a test case for Merx.

**Pre-beta version** if you think that merx can be useful or you like it, [here](https://users.rust-lang.org/t/help-annuncment-merx-let-you-define-decimal-safe-types/40531) a
thread about which direction this library should take.

Merx is a library useful to talk about quantities in a safe way and with an eye on the
performance. It is inspired by this
[article](https://tech.fpcomplete.com/blog/safe-decimal-right-on-the-money) from
[fpcomplete](https://tech.fpcomplete.com/tech).

## How it work:
Merx let you defines assets. An asset is everything that has an amount and can be divided, for
example an asset could be a currency, a commodity, (a physical quantity?) ecc ecc

An asset is characterized by a unit (minimum quantity) and an optional upper bound.
The unit is the smallest part of the asset that the software can express.

Addition between assets of the same type are supported out of the box with operator
overloading. Multiplication and division are implemented between assets and numeric
types with operator overloading. So **asset + asset**, **asset * number**,
**asset / number** are valid operations.

An asset can be either a credit or a debit. A debit can only contain negative amounts. A credit can
only contains positive amounts.

Merx expose `Asset` that is a wrapper around a `Debt` or a `Credit` that are wrapper around a
numeric value.
The wrapped numeric value is a dummy fixed value defined in [*/src/fixed.rs*](./src.fixed.rs)

```rust
pub struct <T: NUMERIC>Debt(T);
pub struct <T: NUMERIC>Credit(T);

pub enum Asset<T: NUMERIC> {
    Debt(Debt(T)),NUMERIC
    Credit(Credit(T)),
}
```

The permitted operations are: 
* `Credit - Debt` that is positive_value + negative_value [TODO remove it it should be `Credit + Debt`]
* `Credit + Credit` that is value + value
* `Debt + Credit` that is negative_value + positive_value
* `Debt + Debt` that is negative_value + negative_value
* `Asset + Asset` that is value + value

## Example
```rust
#[macro_use]
extern crate merx;
use merx::{Asset, Debt, Credit, asset::CheckedOps};

get_traits!();

// Create a new asset called bitcoin with 8 decimal digits and a max value of 21 million of units
new_asset!(bitcoin, 8, 21_000_000);
// Create a new asset called usd with 2 decimal digits and a max value of 14_000_000_000_000 units
new_asset!(usd, 2, 14_000_000_000_000);

type Bitcoin = Asset<bitcoin::Value>;
type Usd = Asset<usd::Value>;

fn main() {
    // A tuple that define a decimal value as (mantissa, decimal part)
    let tot_amount = (679, 1); // -> 67.9
    let tot_amount = Bitcoin::try_from(tot_amount).unwrap();
    let to_pay = Bitcoin::try_from(-29).unwrap();
    let remain = (tot_amount + to_pay).unwrap();
    println!("{:#?}", remain);

    // With a float also a rounding method must be provided, this because Merx must know what to do
    // with floats with higher precision than the asset. Possible rounding methods are Trunc Floor
    // Ceil Round and they behaved the same as rust's f64 methods with the same names.
    let usd = Usd::try_from((10.87, FloatRounding::Trunc)).unwrap();
    println!("{:#?}", usd);

    // When the source of the float is a text string the best thing to do is to parse the value
    // from a string.
    let usd = Usd::try_from("10.87").unwrap();
    println!("{:#?}", usd);

    // TODO smouthly conversion
    //let x: USD = match remain {
    //    Credit(x) => interests(USD::from(x), 12, 3);
    //    Debt(x) => interests(USD::from(x), 12, 3);
    //};
}

// You can define function over generic assets:

// Adding assets of type T return an asset of type T
fn add_assets<T: CheckedOps>(x: Asset<T>, y: Asset<T>) -> Option<Asset<T>> {
    x + y
}

// Adding credits can only result in a Credit
fn add_credits<T: CheckedOps>(x: Credit<T>, y: Credit<T>) -> Option<Credit<T>> {
    x + y
}

// Adding debts can only result in a Debt
fn add_debts<T: CheckedOps>(x: Debt<T>, y: Debt<T>) -> Option<Debt<T>> {
    x + y
}

```

## Safety

1. Is impossible to add assets of different types or add an asset with a numeric value.
2. Every operation that concern an asset (add mul div) is checked and fail on incorrect values.
3. Build assets from primitive types is safe [TODO].
4. When the result of an operation is positive we have a `Credit` otherwise we have `Debt`, is not
possible to build a `Credit` with a negative value or a `Debt` with a positive value.
5. The library have 0 dependency.

## Performance

Merx in order to add assets do a checked add. From the benchmark it seems that Merx is a
little faster in doing that than a plain function like the one below.

```rust
fn checked_add_and_compare_64(a: i64, b: i64, max: i64) -> Option<i64> {
    let sum = a.checked_add(b)?;
    if sum.checked_abs()? <= max {
        return Some(sum);
    }
    return None
}
```

```

This happens also when assets are multiplied or divided. I think that the library is not
slow but I can not justify the above numbers. I'm not confident in these benchmarks and in my
benchmarking ability, the benchmarks must be reviewed.
